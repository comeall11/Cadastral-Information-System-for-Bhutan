Introduction:






Imports:

The following imports will be required for this program:

os: This module will be used to interact with the operating system. It provides a way to access environment variables, manage file paths, and execute system commands.

json: This module provides methods for encoding and decoding JSON data. It will be used to handle data in a standardized format.

jinja2: This module provides a template engine that will be used to render dynamic HTML content.

psycopg2: This module provides a way to interact with a PostgreSQL database from Python. It will be used to create, read, update, and delete data from the database.

Flask: This is a micro web framework for Python that will be used to create the web application.

render_template: This function is part of the Flask module and is used to render Jinja2 templates.

request: This module provides access to incoming request data. It will be used to handle form submissions and other user input.

jsonify: This function is part of the Flask module and is used to return JSON responses.

Flask_sqlalchemy: This is a Flask extension that provides a simple interface for interacting with SQL databases. It will be used to create and manage the database schema.

Functionality:
The Python program will be designed to perform the following tasks:

Serve web pages to users that allow them to view and interact with data stored in a PostgreSQL database.

Allow users to submit data via forms on the web pages, which will be stored in the database.

Allow users to search and filter the data displayed on the web pages.

Provide an API endpoint that returns data in JSON format.

Implement authentication and authorization to restrict access to certain parts of the web application.

Use Jinja2 templates to render dynamic HTML content.

Implement error handling to gracefully handle exceptions and errors that may occur during runtime.

Use Flask_sqlalchemy to manage the database schema and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database.
